(3) Explain your answer instead of simply posting the code. Tell the reason that caused the error to happen.

(4) It was absurd that RIAA sued Jesse and other 3 students for running the search engines. Apparently Jesse did not make any profit out of the search engine and wasn't mean to be a so called "pirate". Although Jesse may have helped the spread of those music files unwillingly, RIAA could have sent him a email to ask him to modify his search engine and erase those files, instead they sent a lawsuit directly. As we can see from the article, if Jesse is willing to pay for the cost to fight the RIAA, he may even win. Seems that the RIAA was just trying to make money out of charging poor students who did not intend to infringe the copyright and take away their money. However, the RIAA was meant to protect intellectual property rights and the first amendment rights of artists, which is clearly not what they are doing in this story.
