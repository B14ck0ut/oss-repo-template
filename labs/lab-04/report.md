3. A license tells other what they can do or what they can't. If there is no license in your project, no one can use or modify it. Also, the license protects your right and the users'. <br />

4. Lack of an explict license probably would discourge or even prevent others to contribute to your project. And when there is a dispute, your poor license is very unlikely to help you. <br />

5. I agree with the claim. With open-source development, the Web team does a better job in communicating with the public and get their help to improve the project. Also, it seems very unwise to fork blindly without the support of open-source system. <br />

6. Android is about freedom and choice. The purpose of Android is to promote openness in the mobile world, and the developers couldn't predict or dictate all the uses for their software. LGPL libraries could be restrictive for Android. First of all, LGPL requires shipping of source to the application; a written offer for source; or linking the LGPL-ed library dynamically and allowing users to manually upgrade or replace the library. Android software is typically shipped as a static system image, so complying with these requirements restricts device manufacturer designs. Next, LGPL requires the allowance of customer modification and reverse engineering for debugging those modifications. Last but not least, LGPL libraries have been the source of many compliance problems for downstream device makers and application developers. Educating engineers on these issues is difficult and time consuming. These issues discussed above are the reasons for preferring Apache 2.0 for Android.
